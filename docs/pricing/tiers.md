## 💰 Pricing Philosophy: Why We Do This

### The Authentication Pricing Trap

Most authentication providers use a **"bait-and-switch" model**:

1. **Auth0**: "Free for 7,000 MAU!" → Then $240/mo → Then $2,000/mo → Then $5,000/mo for SSO
2. **Clerk**: "Free for 10,000 MAU!" → Then $100/mo for MFA → Then $100+/mo for organizations → Then $$$$ for SSO
3. **SuperTokens**: "Open-source!" → Then "See pricing" for organizations → Then $100/mo minimum for self-hosted
4. **Firebase**: "Free!" → Then "Enterprise pricing" for SAML SSO → Then vendor lock-in nightmare

**The Pattern**: Start cheap, then **extract value by gating essential features**.

### The Plinto Way

We believe this is **wrong**. Authentication is infrastructure. Essential features shouldn't cost extra.

**Our Model**:
- ✅ **All features free in OSS** (MIT license, no restrictions)
- ✅ **Charge for convenience** (managed hosting, SLA, support)
- ✅ **Charge for services** (migration help, SSO setup, compliance)
- ✅ **Never charge for capabilities** (no feature gates, ever)

**What This Means**:
- You can use Plinto OSS forever for $0
- You can self-host 1 million users for free
- You can add enterprise SSO without paying us
- You can migrate away anytime (we even help you!)

**When You Pay Us**:
- You don't want to manage infrastructure → Plinto Cloud
- You need SLA guarantees → Plinto Cloud
- You want us to set up your SAML → Enterprise services
- You need compliance certifications → Enterprise compliance package

## 🔄 Migration Path: The "Eject Button"

Unlike Auth0/Clerk, **you can always leave**:

### Cloud → OSS Migration
1. Export your data (API provided)
2. Deploy Plinto OSS on your infrastructure
3. Import your data (scripts provided)
4. Point your DNS to your server
5. Done. No data loss, no re-enrollment.

**Time**: 2-4 hours  
**Downtime**: Zero (with dual-write approach)  
**Cost**: $0  
**Documentation**: [Complete guide](../migration/cloud-to-self-hosted.md)

### Competitor → Plinto Migration
We help you migrate from:
- **Auth0**: Full user export, password migration
- **Clerk**: User export, credential re-enrollment
- **Firebase**: Google Auth migration
- **Okta**: SSO configuration transfer

**Enterprise customers**: We do the migration for you.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### "Why is SSO free? Everyone else charges for it."

Because **we believe it's wrong to charge for essential security features**. Enterprise SSO is table stakes for B2B SaaS. Making it a paid add-on is a tax on companies trying to secure their users.

We charge for making SSO **easy** (zero-config, automatic setup), not for the **feature itself**.

### "How do you make money if everything is free?"

1. **Plinto Cloud** (managed hosting convenience)
2. **Enterprise Services** (setup assistance, migration help, training)
3. **Compliance Packaging** (SOC 2, HIPAA certifications access)
4. **SLA Guarantees** (99.99% uptime, dedicated support)

We make money from **service and convenience**, not **feature access**.

### "Can I really use Plinto OSS for production?"

**Yes.** It's the same code that powers Plinto Cloud. MIT license. No restrictions. No hidden fees.

You'll need to:
- Manage your own infrastructure (Docker/K8s)
- Handle backups and monitoring
- Set up SSL certificates
- Perform version upgrades

If you have DevOps capacity, OSS is a great choice.

### "What if I outgrow the Starter plan?"

Upgrade to Professional or Scale. No migration needed. Just change billing.

Pricing is **transparent and predictable**: Based on MAU, not on "contact sales."

### "What happens if I stop paying?"

**Plinto Cloud**: Your hosted instance stops. But you can:
1. Export all your data (API available even after cancellation)
2. Deploy Plinto OSS on your infrastructure
3. Import your data and point DNS to your server
4. Continue running with zero data loss

**OSS**: Nothing. You own it. Keep running it forever.

### "Do I own my data?"

**Yes. Always.**

- OSS: Data is in YOUR database that YOU control
- Cloud: Data is in OUR database, but YOU can export it anytime
- Enterprise: Data can be in YOUR VPC if needed

We never "own" your users. You do.

### "Can I modify Plinto for my needs?"

**OSS**: Yes. MIT license. Fork it, modify it, sell it.  
**Cloud**: No. Managed service, can't modify core.  
**Enterprise**: Custom features available (we build for you).

### "What's the catch?"

**There is no catch.**

We genuinely believe authentication should be free and open. We're building a sustainable business by charging for **service**, not **features**.

If you prefer self-hosting, use OSS forever for $0. We're happy.  
If you want convenience, pay for Cloud. We're happy.  
If you need enterprise services, pay for Enterprise. We're happy.

**You choose your path. We don't trap you.**
