# Archived Inaccurate Documentation - January 2025

⚠️ **WARNING: DOCUMENTATION IN THIS DIRECTORY IS INACCURATE**

These files have been archived because they contain severely incorrect assessments of the Plinto codebase that were disproven by evidence-based analysis in November 2025.

## Why Archived

The January 2025 analysis claimed:
- ❌ "40-45% production ready" → Actually 75-80%
- ❌ "Enterprise features 100% missing" → All fully implemented
- ❌ "Build system broken" → 75% builds successfully
- ❌ "65% feature gap" → Actual gap ~20-25%

## Correct Documentation

See instead:
- **Current Assessment**: `.serena/memories/comprehensive_audit_november_17_2025.md`
- **Project Overview**: `.serena/memories/project_overview.md`
- **Accurate Feature Inventory**: `.serena/memories/comprehensive_feature_inventory.md`

## Archived Files

The following memories and documents were based on incorrect January analysis:
- `comprehensive_analysis_jan2025_16nov` (primary incorrect assessment)
- `comprehensive_audit_jan2025` (duplicate with same inaccuracies)
- `production_readiness_analysis_jan2025` (based on incorrect data)
- `brutal_honest_publishability_assessment_jan2025` (overly pessimistic)
- `stability_analysis_jan2025` (build system incorrectly assessed as broken)

**Date Archived**: November 17, 2025  
**Reason**: Evidence-based audit proved claims false  
**Replacement**: Comprehensive audit with 100+ command verifications
